# Iris Flower Classification Project

## Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline designed to classify iris flowers into one of three species: *Iris-setosa*, *Iris-versicolor*, and *Iris-virginica*. The project uses the classic Iris dataset, which is well-suited for demonstrating fundamental machine learning concepts. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify new iris flower samples based on sepal and petal dimensions.

## Project Workflow
### 1. Data Loading and Exploration
- Load the Iris dataset using `scikit-learn` and convert it into a `pandas DataFrame`.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and its features.
- Visualize data distributions and relationships using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Split the dataset into training and test sets to create `X_train`, `X_test`, `y_train`, and `y_test`.
- Scale the feature data using `StandardScaler` to prepare for model training.

### 3. Model Training and Evaluation
- Use models such as **Logistic Regression** as a baseline.
- Fit the model to the training data and evaluate performance on the test data.
- Visualize results using a confusion matrix and print out the classification report.

### 4. Future Work
- Test the model with synthetic or new data to further evaluate generalization.
- Experiment with other models like **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Decision Tree Classifier**, or **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**.
- Implement hyperparameter tuning for performance improvement.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository or download the project folder.
2. Ensure you have Python and all required libraries installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

## Results

- The current model (Logistic Regression) achieved an accuracy of 100% on the test set, indicating strong performance on this dataset. However, further testing with new data is recommended to verify generalization.
